            <p><strong>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; English: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.The septet—composed of the members <q>Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook</q>—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.</strong> Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.<blockquote> Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.</blockquote> Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.</p>
            
        <h3>Name</h3>
            
            <p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression <strong>Bangtan Sonyeondan</strong>, literally meaning <em> "Bulletproof Boy Scouts"</em>. According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire <em> "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets"</em> .In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity. This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."</p>

                <dt>Musical Style</dt>
                <dd>BTS co-write and produce much of their own output. Since their inception, BTS have developed and maintained a style of "fusion music" with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers.Rather than adhering to a specific genre, BTS have introduced new elements into their sound and musical repertoire with each successive release. </dd>
                <dt>Lyrical Themes</dt>
                <dd>The lyrical themes explored in the songs and albums of BTS have included diverse themes such as the issues of social identity in youth, anxieties of school-age youth, and mental health in youth culture.BTS' albums have been described in 2017 as contained recurring themes that fall under the overarching theme of "reflection of youth."In 2016, their "youth series" "tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society."</dd>
                <dt>Cultural Impact</dt>
                <dd>BTS have been described as "easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world" that can "do things no other name in their genre can".They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic."As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms.In 2020, BTS became the first non-English artist to be named IFPI's #1 Global Recording Artist of the Year. They currently remain as the only non-English speaking act to enter that list. </dd>
