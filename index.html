    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>In progressive enhancement, it focuses on content. Allowing everyone to at least have access to the basic content and function of a web page. Also letting the people with extra features such as fast internet to have even better versions instead. Progressive enhancement is useful in the modern web since it works for all types of users and their needs, making it accessible for everyone. It provides the essential content and functionality to as many users. While also giving better experience, to other users who are able to. So every user can see the most important thing which is the content in this case. It is important since it ensures stability across the browsers. Another article I found related to this topic was called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/" target="_blank">“What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters”</a>.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>One suggestion that was brought up while showing my friends the website was to remove the background and overview part for all the pages except for the homepage. Since it isn’t related to other pages. Also that maybe I can add more pictures on the other pages. I thought about removing it but chose not to make that change. Since if a person gets on the history or faq page without looking much at the homepage. It would be useful for them to have some basic information about SpaceX and the Dragon vehicle. Some other suggestions I received were to make the font on the homepage bigger and bolder, which I ended up doing since I want the heading to stand out from the rest of the content. They also said to somehow make it easier for the user to understand that they can click on the faq questions to show the answers to them. I will try to implement this as well, to make it easier for others to use. </p>
    <p>During this semester we learned many things, and while doing smaller projects related to them. Which helped make the content more understandable. Also during this semester, we learned a lot of new information in a short amount of time, but it was easy to understand. The learning experience I got from working on this project was that it helped me use all the information and knowledge we had learned since, to work on this. The final project helped me with using and putting together everything we learned together since we don’t get to do that too much. By the time we started working on this project, I was pretty confident with my HTML and CSS skills since we had been working on it for a pretty long time. If I had to start over I would probably still do the same thing. </p>
